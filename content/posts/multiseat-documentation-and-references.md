Trying to put some order with all the multiseat documentation found on Web, today I updated the following:

Multiseat's article, in X.Org Foundation wiki:
http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/Multiseat

Multiseat's history, in Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiseat#History

So if you are trying to setup or help in development, probably the foundation's wiki has the most up to date and centralized references. Also, please, if you have more helpful information, don't be afraid to update the wikis. Our future grandsons will be thankful  :)
