Given that GSoC '08 is getting close to the end, [strategy number 2](http://vignatti.wordpress.com/2008/07/29/improving-input-latency/) showed more feasible to proceed my work. Strategy #3 would be a lot of fun but would imply a hell massive codification as well (also a little out of [our scope](http://vignatti.wordpress.com/2008/04/29/google-summer-of-code-2008/)). Unfortunately no-no for now.
