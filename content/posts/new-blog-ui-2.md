I like UI and I'm not gay.

Some time ago someone posted a [comment](http://vignatti.wordpress.com/2009/01/14/cursors-update-inside-kernel-only/#comment-1614), complaining about the white fonts over the dark background in my blog, which makes the read be difficult. The guy teased me, recommending an [ironic page](http://www.ironicsans.com/owmyeyes/) where shows how hard is to read texts like this. He was right...

So now I changed wordpress to a totally opposite theme called "White as Milk". Yay, total white and easy to read now! Let's see how long I'll get sick of that interface.
