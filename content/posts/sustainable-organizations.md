At [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/) we help make the Internet work better by improving web browsers like Chrome and Safari. We also work with the underlying technologies that make websites look and function properly, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—the building blocks of every web application.

In everything we do, we try to place a strong emphasis on **[social responsibility](https://www.igalia.com/about/social-responsibility)**. This means that our focus extends beyond profit to making a positive impact on society. Igalia is built on values of **[equality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du7fC8VCbXg)** and **[transparency](https://www.igalia.com/chats/val)**, which are deeply embedded in our organizational structure. These commitments to social responsibility shape the core principles that guide our work.

Below are some principles that I frequently observe at Igalia and that I personally appreciate. I believe these **principles could be applied to any well-structured organization committed to a sustainable future**.

### Transparent Structure

A successful organization must be built on respect, with well-defined roles and clear communication:
- **Healthy Environment**: A culture of respect that fosters egalitarian and cooperative values strengthens collaboration and overall well-being.
- **Accountability**: Clearly defined responsibilities and decision-making processes ensure transparency and drive progress toward sustainability goals.
- **Clear Communication**: Open communication about financial matters, projects, and responsibilities is essential for keeping all members well-informed and engaged.

### Democratic Participation
In an organization committed to a sustainable future, power is decentralized and all members have an active voice:
- **Horizontal Communication**: Communication must always be inclusive, transparent, and participatory.
- **Consensus-Based Decision Making**: Regular discussions, open forums, and information sharing are crucial to align members toward common goals.


### Open Technologies
The adoption of open technologies enhances transparency and ensures freedom of information, preventing dependence on proprietary infrastructures.
- **Open Data**: Making information accessible and useful drives collaboration, innovation, and informed decision-making. Publicly available data empowers oversight by official institutions and civil society, reinforcing transparency and accountability.
- **Data Security & Privacy**: While transparency is essential, user privacy must be a top priority. Ethical data management practices should ensure that personal information is always protected while public data is open.
