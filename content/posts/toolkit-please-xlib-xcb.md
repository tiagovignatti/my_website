We all know since 2006 (?) that the world is turning to use XCB instead Xlib as the interface between X clients and the server. The advantages of using XCB is [well know](http://xcb.freedesktop.org/Features/) but, even so, it's being adopted very slowly for some reason - for instance no toolkits yet ported it. If this serves as a motivation, [Alan](http://blogs.sun.com/alanc/) got a really [nice measurements](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xcb/2010-June/006111.html) porting a simple X app.  

Translate your toolkit and application **now**! :)
