Certainly, my great new is that I was accepted as a student of [X.Org Foundation](http://www.x.org/) sponsored by Google, on [Summer of Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code) 2007.  The project's name is **Moving the mouse handling code into a separate thread** and in this [link ](http://people.freedesktop.org/~vignatti/SoC_input-handling-proposal.html)you can see what does this mean specifically.

Possibly, for some time this blog will be filled with a lot of posts regarding this subject :D :D :D
