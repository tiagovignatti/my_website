Last week I've been in Brazil at 11th International Free Software Forum (FISL) talking about Linux Graphics for Small Devices*. I tried to cover a bit of everything that I learned in the world I've been immersed in some near past - I guess there aren't many news for _freedesktopers_ though. Anyway, everyone is very welcome to give any kind of feedback and comment on it. Just follow [here](http://people.freedesktop.org/~vignatti/talks/FISL11-LinuxGraphicsForSmallDevices.pdf).

*actually, two nights in Porto Alegre and two nights in Curitiba. Was great to see most of my friends!
