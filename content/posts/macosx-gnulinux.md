I used a part of the money that I earned on the SoC 2007 to buy a laptop to me. My university friends found a good price of a MacBook and we went to the shop in a total of 6 people (!) to buy this laptop trying to get some discount. It cost R$ 3400 (about USD 1800), a very cheap value to the Brazil standards.

Fine. My MacBook arrived one week ago. The shiny laptop is cool, but the OS **really** **not**. I tried to accustom myself for at least one week with that OS and I failed. The reason why is better explained by these guys below:
