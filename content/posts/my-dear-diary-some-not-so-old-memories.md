**_Portland, OR_**

I was so proud for the forth time be part of the X crew, this time in Portland. Really amazing the city. I had the opportunity to play tourist and visit [some nice places](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tiagovignatti/sets/72157622611218823/).

_**My X conferences**_

BTW, I just collect the photos of all four [X conferences that I've attended](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tiagovignatti/collections/72157622382815859/). It's not much photos but there's some funny things :)

**_X on embedded_**

The cool thing of the work that I'm doing at Nokia is that I can publish and discuss mostly all X fun with the open source communities. "Mostly" because, for the last device - the N-shiny-and-awesome-900 - for instance, the video driver is closed (provided by Imagination), so we cannot comment much regarding such driver stack :( C'est la vie.

So we've been using Xorg for our small devices (FWIW the development of kdrive based servers is dead! Period). Therefore, myself and Oliver brought to XDC [some discussions](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2009/Notes#head-f9dc26bf85deb2cfa680eac7055475aa9957eb16) that we had about X server for tiny systems. Xorg DDX is still too fat. There's a lot of code that we can cut off and that was the whole idea of [our talk](http://www.inf.ufpr.br/vignatti/talks/xdc2009-nokia.pdf), more concerned about Xorg's memory footprint.

_**Life is beautiful**_

6 months living in Helsinki: hosted 4 visits of friends, 5 new European countries visited and an average of 2 pints per day :) Lot of fun and no time at all for opensource pet projects. Even so, I'm enjoying! Besides, I bought an skate board and I'm speaking the first Finnish words already. I'm happy also that I'm (finally) finding time again to appreciate a [g](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Z%C3%A9)[o](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeto_Pascoal)[o](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_zappa)[d](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Beck) [m](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_(band))[u](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician))[s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Abujamra)[i](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.E.R.D)[c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Brothers) (but didn't get a guitar yet for me here). Let's see what will be my next musical project... Nähdään!
