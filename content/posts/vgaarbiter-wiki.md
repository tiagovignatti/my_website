Today, [Paulo Zanoni](http://przanoni.blogspot.com/) help me to put in a shape the VgaArbiter wiki page.
The primary intention of that page is to bring more developers in that
project and some users++ who could also help testing. Feedback is very
welcome. [Here](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/VgaArbiter) is the link.
