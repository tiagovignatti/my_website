Usually faster the number of commits, faster the development process. But development without strict reviewing doesn't  guarantee quality on the code. Unfortunately, rarely you will see people willing or even just being able to review the changes you are proposing. Attract reviewers is hard!

Lemma:
_**The art of writing a good patch series is all about to attract reviewers.**_

Proof is omitted due to lack of space. Sorry ;)

I'd start to write a post about how to write a nice commit message and patch series, so I could use as a future reference _for you_.

( Note I'm not judging that _you_ are often writing patches wrongly. I'm just trying let _you_ aware that _you_ can do it much better so _your_ changes can go smoothly in the project. )

However a quick search showed that Peter already did a nice post about it.  Please take a look [there](http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html). I recommend (signed-off-by)!
