### A quote

### Open-source

I've used to do a bunch of open-source software stuff. Some are living in [GitHub](https://github.com/tiagovignatti) now. You can check out also some stuff I've worked on throughout my career in the [projects](/projects/) page.

### Career

In the past, I spent considerable time exploring distance learning and future technologies involving Virtual and Augmented Reality, co-founding **[Imersys](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/imersys)**.

Prior to that, I lived in Helsinki, Finland, where I worked at **Intel** and earlier at **Nokia** as a Linux Graphics Engineer. You can find more details on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagovignatti/).

Before graduating, I worked at **C3SL** at the **Federal University of Paraná** in Curitiba, Brazil. During that time, I also engaged in academic research, focusing on [Distributed Archiving Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5284519) and [Peer-to-Peer networks](http://www.inf.ufpr.br/bona/disser-vignatti.pdf).
