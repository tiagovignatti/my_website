### Distance Learning

I'm thinking about distance learning and future technologies. I've co-founded **[imersys.com](https://www.imersys.com)**. 

### A quote

"The more seriously you take yourself, the unhappier you’re going to be.", Naval Ravikant

### Open-source

I've used to do a bunch of open-source software stuff. Some are living in [GitHub](https://github.com/tiagovignatti) now.

### Career

 Previously I've lived in Helsinki, Finland where I've worked at **Intel** and before that at **Nokia** as a Linux Graphics Engineer. More details on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagovignatti/).

 Before graduating I worked in **C3SL** at **Federal University of Paraná** in Curitiba, Brazil. At that time I've also experienced the academic side, researching on [Distributed Archiving Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5284519) and [Peer-to-Peer](http://www.inf.ufpr.br/bona/disser-vignatti.pdf).
