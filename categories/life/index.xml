    <description><![CDATA[Last week I&rsquo;ve been in Brazil at 11th International Free Software Forum (FISL) talking about Linux Graphics for Small Devices*. I tried to cover a bit of everything that I learned in the world I&rsquo;ve been immersed in some near past - I guess there aren&rsquo;t many news for freedesktopers though. Anyway, everyone is very welcome to give any kind of feedback and comment on it. Just follow here.
*actually, two nights in Porto Alegre and two nights in Curitiba.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Portland, OR
I was so proud for the forth time be part of the X crew, this time in Portland. Really amazing the city. I had the opportunity to play tourist and visit some nice places.
My X conferences
BTW, I just collect the photos of all four X conferences that I&rsquo;ve attended. It&rsquo;s not much photos but there&rsquo;s some funny things :)
X on embedded
The cool thing of the work that I&rsquo;m doing at Nokia is that I can publish and discuss mostly all X fun with the open source communities.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I used a part of the money that I earned on the SoC 2007 to buy a laptop to me. My university friends found a good price of a MacBook and we went to the shop in a total of 6 people (!) to buy this laptop trying to get some discount. It cost R$ 3400 (about USD 1800), a very cheap value to the Brazil standards.
Fine. My MacBook arrived one week ago.]]></description>
