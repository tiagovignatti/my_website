    <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week I&rsquo;ve been in Brazil at 11th International Free Software Forum (FISL) talking about Linux Graphics for Small Devices*. I tried to cover a bit of everything that I learned in the world I&rsquo;ve been immersed in some near past - I guess there aren&rsquo;t many news for <em>freedesktopers</em> though. Anyway, everyone is very welcome to give any kind of feedback and comment on it. Just follow <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~vignatti/talks/FISL11-LinuxGraphicsForSmallDevices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>.</p>
<p>*actually, two nights in Porto Alegre and two nights in Curitiba. Was great to see most of my friends!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Portland, OR</em></strong></p>
<p>I was so proud for the forth time be part of the X crew, this time in Portland. Really amazing the city. I had the opportunity to play tourist and visit <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tiagovignatti/sets/72157622611218823/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">some nice places</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>My X conferences</strong></em></p>
<p>BTW, I just collect the photos of all four <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tiagovignatti/collections/72157622382815859/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">X conferences that I&rsquo;ve attended</a>. It&rsquo;s not much photos but there&rsquo;s some funny things :)</p>
<p><strong><em>X on embedded</em></strong></p>
<p>The cool thing of the work that I&rsquo;m doing at Nokia is that I can publish and discuss mostly all X fun with the open source communities. &ldquo;Mostly&rdquo; because, for the last device - the N-shiny-and-awesome-900 - for instance, the video driver is closed (provided by Imagination), so we cannot comment much regarding such driver stack :( C&rsquo;est la vie.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I used a part of the money that I earned on the SoC 2007 to buy a laptop to me. My university friends found a good price of a MacBook and we went to the shop in a total of 6 people (!) to buy this laptop trying to get some discount. It cost R$ 3400 (about USD 1800), a very cheap value to the Brazil standards.</p>
<p>Fine. My MacBook arrived one week ago. The shiny laptop is cool, but the OS <strong>really</strong> <strong>not</strong>. I tried to accustom myself for at least one week with that OS and I failed. The reason why is better explained by these guys below:</p>]]></description>
