            </div><p>Oculus Quest. It’s a cool step forward, no doubt: an all-in-one headset, with touch controllers, inside-out 6DOF tracking, no sensors, no wires, headphones and so on. Neat! I can&rsquo;t wait to put my hands on it&hellip; but, there&rsquo;s a but:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It runs rift quality experiences&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s Zuckerberg&rsquo;s words. And they&rsquo;re twice wrong.</p>
<p>Rift device runs tethered to a PC, which is a x86 architecture based machine. The Quest will be running on a Snapdragon 8xx processor, which is a mobile processor, SoC architecture. There&rsquo;s no way to compare the mobile architecture&rsquo;s processing capabilities with the x86 one and its way more powerful CPUs / GPUs – roughly speaking, one focuses on power consumption while the other on performance.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<div id="id-1"><p>About a year ago <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/&#43;/HEAD/docs/ozone_overview.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Ozone platform abstraction layer</a> started to take its shape in Chromium and we were excited how easily we could s<a href="https://vignatti.com/posts/welcome-to-chromiums-ozone-wayland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">upport Wayland platform</a> using it. Everything went great and we helped a few Chromium targets like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosswalk_Project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Crosswalk</a> to debut in the Tizen ecosystem for example. More recently, different Ozone platforms have been implemented and only now it&rsquo;s becoming evident the significance of Ozone for Chromium Linux, generally speaking.</p>]]></description>

You will understand why next.</p>
<p><strong>communities</strong></p>
<p>There are three main projects involved in here: <em>Chromium</em>, <em>Wayland</em> and <em>Ozone-Wayland</em>. In Chromium, there is a very big and geek community that mainly produces Chrome browser and Chrome-OS. Very near to that one there&rsquo;s Blink engine&rsquo;s community, which interacts (and overlaps) a lot with the Chromium&rsquo;s; I can&rsquo;t tell exactly in numbers but there&rsquo;s huge number of people, vendors and commercial involved in Chromium and, more important to us, there&rsquo;s a lot of quality code being cooked in there for leveraging Web technologies in general.</p>]]></description>

<hr>
<p>Ozone is a set of C++ classes in Chromium for abstracting different window systems on Linux. It provides abstraction for the construction of accelerated surfaces underlying Aura UI framework, input devices assignment and event handling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/ozone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/ozone</a></p>
<p>Today we are launching publicly Ozone-Wayland, which is the implementation of Chromium&rsquo;s Ozone for supporting Wayland graphics system. Different projects based on Chromium/Blink like the Chrome browser, ChromeOS, among others can be enabled now using Wayland.</p>]]></description>

Those are very important points to consider, of course, but for one individual actually programming the graphics system the answer should be straightforward: Wayland API is damn small.</p>

    <title>X on Wayland</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>A rather cool feature on Weston compositor is xwayland, to support X11 native applications on Wayland. It&rsquo;s a quite important feature because gives the compatibility with the &ldquo;old&rdquo; windowing system, so say you have an application written on Motif/Xt or even something more &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; like a Web browser all tied with GTK2 and whatever dependency, then you better not bother yourself re-writing it to native Wayland or porting to a modern toolkit &ndash; it should just work seamlessly on it. Hence, X on Wayland fits pretty well with our overall transition plan.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you wanna contribute to a funky open-source project? Are you tired of your nerdy and boring community of developers? Are you the one that wants to get rid of X because it&rsquo;s a giant, old and fat dinosaur in your system? :) Cool, I have a project to solve your problems!</p>
<hr>
<p>While there&rsquo;s still lot of churn in the protocol, and yet our goal is soon to wrap up all we&rsquo;ve been doing to a steady and settle-on-the-stone one description, there&rsquo;s a lot on the implementation side that needs love. And that mainly concern Weston compositor, which is becoming the de facto compositor on several systems targeting Wayland.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Qt on wayland: howto</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>To run Qt applications on Wayland is fairly simple nowadays. Thank to Qt developers, they are following up quite well our last changes on Wayland protocol and updating accordingly on Qt5 code base &ndash; by the way, the fresh and just released Qt 4.8 <a href="https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/blobs/4.8/src/plugins/platforms/wayland/wayland_sha1.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">does not ship the latest</a> protocol additions, so that&rsquo;s not the one I&rsquo;m referring.</p>
<p>So, today I&rsquo;ve set up the last bits of Qt environment on my Intel Pine-Trail pretty easy (yeah, I compile on my tablet :-O). You don&rsquo;t need to clone the whole data base for starting hacking on it. Let&rsquo;s see.</p>]]></description>
