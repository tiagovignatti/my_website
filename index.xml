            </div>Oculus Quest. It’s a cool step forward, no doubt: an all-in-one headset, with touch controllers, inside-out 6DOF tracking, no sensors, no wires, headphones and so on. Neat! I can&rsquo;t wait to put my hands on it&hellip; but, there&rsquo;s a but:
&ldquo;It runs rift quality experiences&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s Zuckerberg&rsquo;s words. And they&rsquo;re twice wrong.
Rift device runs tethered to a PC, which is a x86 architecture based machine. The Quest will be running on a Snapdragon 8xx processor, which is a mobile processor, SoC architecture.]]></description>

            </div>I&rsquo;ve wrote an article about the new graphics platform for Chromium called Ozone-GBM. I particularly think that Ozone-GBM will play an important role next in Chromium and Linux graphics communities in general. I hope you enjoy the read :) Please share it.

            </div>A few weeks ago we released Ozone-Wayland and now we&rsquo;d like to detail for you the development process and strategy behind it&hellip; ah, and the title is not developing Chromium, the browser; it&rsquo;s developing Chromium,** the project**! You will understand why next.

There are three main projects involved in here: Chromium, Wayland and Ozone-Wayland. In Chromium, there is a very big and geek community that mainly produces Chrome browser and Chrome-OS.]]></description>

            </div>The following message was sent out this morning &ndash; I&rsquo;m copying it here and attaching a cute screenshot of my desktop :)
 Ozone is a set of C++ classes in Chromium for abstracting different window systems on Linux. It provides abstraction for the construction of accelerated surfaces underlying Aura UI framework, input devices assignment and event handling.

Today we are launching publicly Ozone-Wayland, which is the implementation of Chromium&rsquo;s Ozone for supporting Wayland graphics system.]]></description>

            </div>Let&rsquo;s forget for a second about video drivers, whether it has acceleration or not, and all the related issues with hardware support on Wayland. This is all solved. Let&rsquo;s talk about the user interface (UI) and ways to customize it all over the computing continuum &ndash; from phones, tablets and TV box to desktop PCs, Invehicle Infotainment (IVI), aeroplane systems, among others.

    <title>the damn small Wayland API</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Wayland 1.0 release is knocking the door and people keep asking &ldquo;why Wayland if we got X already&rdquo;, or things like performance, memory consumption, power savings and other kind of advantages on having Wayland instead X. Those are very important points to consider, of course, but for one individual actually programming the graphics system the answer should be straightforward: Wayland API is damn small.
1. But who&rsquo;s going to program Wayland or X?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[A rather cool feature on Weston compositor is xwayland, to support X11 native applications on Wayland. It&rsquo;s a quite important feature because gives the compatibility with the &ldquo;old&rdquo; windowing system, so say you have an application written on Motif/Xt or even something more &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; like a Web browser all tied with GTK2 and whatever dependency, then you better not bother yourself re-writing it to native Wayland or porting to a modern toolkit &ndash; it should just work seamlessly on it.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Do you wanna contribute to a funky open-source project? Are you tired of your nerdy and boring community of developers? Are you the one that wants to get rid of X because it&rsquo;s a giant, old and fat dinosaur in your system? :) Cool, I have a project to solve your problems!
 While there&rsquo;s still lot of churn in the protocol, and yet our goal is soon to wrap up all we&rsquo;ve been doing to a steady and settle-on-the-stone one description, there&rsquo;s a lot on the implementation side that needs love.]]></description>
