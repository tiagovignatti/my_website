    <description><![CDATA[This post was inspired by &ldquo;Short blog post from Madrid&rsquo;s hotel room&rdquo; from my colleague Frédéric Wang. You should really check his post instead! To Fred: thanks for the feedback and review here. I&rsquo;m in for football in the next Summit, alright? :-)
This week, I finally went to A Coruña for the Web Engines Hackfest and internal company meetings. These were my first on-site events since the COVID-19 pandemic. After two years of non-super-exciting virtual conferences I was so glad to finally be able to meet with colleagues and other people from the Web.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Prototyping At the beginning of 2016, myself, Tuomas and João drafted out a skateboard business in Brazil. João, blasé about his electrical engineering endeavours, desperately wanted to practice skydiving and live abroad. He was down to whatever to accomplish his goals, and so he was alright with the much lower endorphin that skateboarding was proving also. That was great, because besides being a great and funny friend, he was also a truly handyman, and we needed that kind of person in our business.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In the midst of the worst health crisis, disturbing patriotism doctrines and a myriad of digital vices that became the gateway to the respect and love that we all crave, my brother recently gave us fulfilling reasons to celebrate The Great Life.
Although the picture below is by itself mesmerizing, that unique moment captured requires a deeper explanation.
What you&rsquo;re seeing is myself and Marianna marrying André, un chevalier parfait, and Francine, la bella.]]></description>

            </div>Oculus Quest. It’s a cool step forward, no doubt: an all-in-one headset, with touch controllers, inside-out 6DOF tracking, no sensors, no wires, headphones and so on. Neat! I can&rsquo;t wait to put my hands on it&hellip; but, there&rsquo;s a but:
&ldquo;It runs rift quality experiences&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s Zuckerberg&rsquo;s words. And they&rsquo;re twice wrong.
Rift device runs tethered to a PC, which is a x86 architecture based machine. The Quest will be running on a Snapdragon 8xx processor, which is a mobile processor, SoC architecture.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[About a year ago Ozone platform abstraction layer started to take its shape in Chromium and we were excited how easily we could support Wayland platform using it. Everything went great and we helped a few Chromium targets like Crosswalk to debut in the Tizen ecosystem for example. More recently, different Ozone platforms have been implemented and only now it&rsquo;s becoming evident the significance of Ozone for Chromium Linux, generally speaking.]]></description>

            </div>A few weeks ago we released Ozone-Wayland and now we&rsquo;d like to detail for you the development process and strategy behind it&hellip; ah, and the title is not developing Chromium, the browser; it&rsquo;s developing Chromium,** the project**! You will understand why next.

There are three main projects involved in here: Chromium, Wayland and Ozone-Wayland. In Chromium, there is a very big and geek community that mainly produces Chrome browser and Chrome-OS.]]></description>

            </div>The following message was sent out this morning &ndash; I&rsquo;m copying it here and attaching a cute screenshot of my desktop :)
Ozone is a set of C++ classes in Chromium for abstracting different window systems on Linux. It provides abstraction for the construction of accelerated surfaces underlying Aura UI framework, input devices assignment and event handling.

Today we are launching publicly Ozone-Wayland, which is the implementation of Chromium&rsquo;s Ozone for supporting Wayland graphics system.]]></description>

            </div>Let&rsquo;s forget for a second about video drivers, whether it has acceleration or not, and all the related issues with hardware support on Wayland. This is all solved. Let&rsquo;s talk about the user interface (UI) and ways to customize it all over the computing continuum &ndash; from phones, tablets and TV box to desktop PCs, Invehicle Infotainment (IVI), aeroplane systems, among others.
