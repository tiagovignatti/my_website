    <description><![CDATA[Do you wanna contribute to a funky open-source project? Are you tired of your nerdy and boring community of developers? Are you the one that wants to get rid of X because it&rsquo;s a giant, old and fat dinosaur in your system? :) Cool, I have a project to solve your problems!
 While there&rsquo;s still lot of churn in the protocol, and yet our goal is soon to wrap up all we&rsquo;ve been doing to a steady and settle-on-the-stone one description, there&rsquo;s a lot on the implementation side that needs love.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Topic&rsquo;s name is a funny (and friendly) devotion to GNOME Census. So let&rsquo;s take a look at some numbers from the time Xorg 1.9 was in development - raw data is here.
Would be unfair to measure only the work that happened e.g. in X server or in the drivers being developed and come up with the statistics about &ldquo;who developed X&rdquo;. X and X development community are quite extensive and don&rsquo;t concern only &ldquo;graphics&rdquo; related, i.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Usually faster the number of commits, faster the development process. But development without strict reviewing doesn&rsquo;t guarantee quality on the code. Unfortunately, rarely you will see people willing or even just being able to review the changes you are proposing. Attract reviewers is hard!
Lemma: The art of writing a good patch series is all about to attract reviewers.
Proof is omitted due to lack of space. Sorry ;) I&rsquo;d start to write a post about how to write a nice commit message and patch series, so I could use as a future reference for you.]]></description>
