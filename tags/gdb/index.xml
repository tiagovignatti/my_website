    <description><![CDATA[I really don&rsquo;t like to read large blog posts. Anyway&hellip;
What I did so far is a separated thread that takes care only the injection stage on the X server queue. Who is interested with the results, please read some past posts in my blog. It is currently in a very good shape (synced with post-mpx merge, all input devices are inside the thread and etc). The implementation looks like this: thread #1 deals with - injection of input events from devices thread #2 deals with - processing of input events to clients - requests from known clients (rendering things) - new client that tries to connect (pretty easy to do)]]></description>
