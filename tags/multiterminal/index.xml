    <description><![CDATA[<p>So last week I <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/7/16/243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">posted</a> on lkml an old patch that we were carrying for a long time in the Linux community. It basically brings the multiple (old) video cards functionally again on Linux and X server (and this time doing on the right and beauty way). For the people that was following multiseat implementations, this is a HUGE step: we will finally be able to discard the old and ugly hack (a mix of Xorg, several Xephyr servers + evdev) and and go to a clean way, starting multiple X servers in parallel. Cool! Well, not that much, because it might take some time to be in your beloved distribution :)</p>]]></description>
