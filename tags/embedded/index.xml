    <description><![CDATA[Last week I&rsquo;ve been in Brazil at 11th International Free Software Forum (FISL) talking about Linux Graphics for Small Devices*. I tried to cover a bit of everything that I learned in the world I&rsquo;ve been immersed in some near past - I guess there aren&rsquo;t many news for _freedesktopers_ though. Anyway, everyone is very welcome to give any kind of feedback and comment on it. Just follow here.
*actually, two nights in Porto Alegre and two nights in Curitiba.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So here goes some statistics of the Xorg process running. All the informations were fetch from /proc/pidof Xorg/{smaps, status}. I used also a script found on the Web to parse and organize these informations; Mikhail Gusarov has extended this script to show a very useful output.
Xorg per se Running just one standalone Xorg -retro. In my system it represents: VmRSS: 5440 kB VmSize: 13620 kB
from those 5440 kB of RSS: 3404 kB (63 %) come from code 1628 kB (30 %) come from malloc/mmap in anonymous memory (heap) 228 kB (4 %) come from other data mapped in memory 180 kB (3 %) come from rodata]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This series of documents explore how the memory is used by the Xorg server. They aim to eventually shrinks the memory footprint of the server and its related components, like X clients, modules being loaded and drivers. Embedded devices with constrained resources are the main focus here. All texts are mostly based on x86 and ARM architectures, under Linux 2.6.33 with Xorg from upstream.
Overview One way to analyse aspects of memory usage of a given program is to scrutinize its object data.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Portland, OR
I was so proud for the forth time be part of the X crew, this time in Portland. Really amazing the city. I had the opportunity to play tourist and visit some nice places.
My X conferences
BTW, I just collect the photos of all four X conferences that I&rsquo;ve attended. It&rsquo;s not much photos but there&rsquo;s some funny things :)
X on embedded
The cool thing of the work that I&rsquo;m doing at Nokia is that I can publish and discuss mostly all X fun with the open source communities.]]></description>
