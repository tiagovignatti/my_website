    <description><![CDATA[Portland, OR
I was so proud for the forth time be part of the X crew, this time in Portland. Really amazing the city. I had the opportunity to play tourist and visit some nice places.
My X conferences
BTW, I just collect the photos of all four X conferences that I&rsquo;ve attended. It&rsquo;s not much photos but there&rsquo;s some funny things :)
X on embedded
The cool thing of the work that I&rsquo;m doing at Nokia is that I can publish and discuss mostly all X fun with the open source communities.]]></description>
