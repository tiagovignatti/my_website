    <description><![CDATA[<p>GSoC summary #1 - July 29</p>
<p>The current implementation of X Window System relies in a signal scheme  to manage the input event coming from hardware devices. This scheme  frequently get blocked when lot of IO is occurring (for instance, when  the process is swapping in/out). Get blocked means for instance a  jumping cursor on the screen and in GUI is always desirable to  prioritize the system responsiveness for end users. The human/computer  interface should be smooth and this is the most user visible aspect of a  system.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The current DRM kernel modesetting tree is already taking care to update the cursor registers and paint it to the screen. Very cool [0].</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve done today is a shortcut between the kernel input layer and DRM to update the cursor directly on screen without the X server be notified always. Of course, a lot of issues raised up together. So let&rsquo;s try to delegates the tasks again.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>For my SoC <a href="http://vignatti.wordpress.com/2008/04/29/google-summer-of-code-2008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">project</a> I need some mechanism to evaluate the improvement of the input thread inside X. So I wrote a simple kernel driver that emulates the mouse device moving and emitting bits of a simple pattern. I don&rsquo;t know if something like this already exists or if there are other ways to do it, but the fact is that the solution I thought took me only few hours between the moment that I imagined, collected some ideas on the Web and implemented it.</p>]]></description>
