    <description><![CDATA[Unfortunately that model which I described some weeks ago to put the input event delivery of the X server in a separate thread wouldn&rsquo;t be an advantage. I precipitated myself thinking that it could be feasible. Sorry :(
I started to implement all this but it showed a very boring task to grab all the globals variables which both threads touch and to lock it. So I decided to stop going in this way.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Input events routed through another thread/process can have bad effects on latency because we can&rsquo;t guarantee that it will get scheduled at the right moment. Although this is hard to see happening with the current X server threaded implementation, we must design something to avoid it. One way to improve the responsiveness is to give a high priority to the input thread and also adjust the CPU scheduling. (Note that this will not avoid problems related with page faults which usually happen in the X input flow.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Given that GSoC &lsquo;08 is getting close to the end, strategy number 2 showed more feasible to proceed my work. Strategy #3 would be a lot of fun but would imply a hell massive codification as well (also a little out of our scope). Unfortunately no-no for now.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[GSoC summary #1 - July 29
The current implementation of X Window System relies in a signal scheme to manage the input event coming from hardware devices. This scheme frequently get blocked when lot of IO is occurring (for instance, when the process is swapping in/out). Get blocked means for instance a jumping cursor on the screen and in GUI is always desirable to prioritize the system responsiveness for end users.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[For my SoC project I need some mechanism to evaluate the improvement of the input thread inside X. So I wrote a simple kernel driver that emulates the mouse device moving and emitting bits of a simple pattern. I don&rsquo;t know if something like this already exists or if there are other ways to do it, but the fact is that the solution I thought took me only few hours between the moment that I imagined, collected some ideas on the Web and implemented it.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I&rsquo;m very happy to say that I was selected again to work on Google Summer of Code with X.Org Foundation. Daniel will be my mentor again. Thanks Google. Thanks X.Org!
In the last year we did a nice work separating the input event generation code of the X server into a different thread. We saw some performance improvement there specially because the implementation is not using signals anymore to wake up the server when some device emits an event.]]></description>
