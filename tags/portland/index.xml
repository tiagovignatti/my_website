    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Portland, OR</em></strong></p>
<p>I was so proud for the forth time be part of the X crew, this time in Portland. Really amazing the city. I had the opportunity to play tourist and visit <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tiagovignatti/sets/72157622611218823/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">some nice places</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>My X conferences</strong></em></p>
<p>BTW, I just collect the photos of all four <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tiagovignatti/collections/72157622382815859/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">X conferences that I&rsquo;ve attended</a>. It&rsquo;s not much photos but there&rsquo;s some funny things :)</p>
<p><strong><em>X on embedded</em></strong></p>
<p>The cool thing of the work that I&rsquo;m doing at Nokia is that I can publish and discuss mostly all X fun with the open source communities. &ldquo;Mostly&rdquo; because, for the last device - the N-shiny-and-awesome-900 - for instance, the video driver is closed (provided by Imagination), so we cannot comment much regarding such driver stack :( C&rsquo;est la vie.</p>]]></description>
