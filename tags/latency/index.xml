    <description><![CDATA[<p>GSoC summary #1 - July 29</p>
<p>The current implementation of X Window System relies in a signal scheme  to manage the input event coming from hardware devices. This scheme  frequently get blocked when lot of IO is occurring (for instance, when  the process is swapping in/out). Get blocked means for instance a  jumping cursor on the screen and in GUI is always desirable to  prioritize the system responsiveness for end users. The human/computer  interface should be smooth and this is the most user visible aspect of a  system.</p>]]></description>
