    <description><![CDATA[About a year ago Ozone platform abstraction layer started to take its shape in Chromium and we were excited how easily we could support Wayland platform using it. Everything went great and we helped a few Chromium targets like Crosswalk to debut in the Tizen ecosystem for example.

            </div>A few weeks ago we released Ozone-Wayland and now we&rsquo;d like to detail for you the development process and strategy behind it&hellip; ah, and the title is not developing Chromium, the browser; it&rsquo;s developing Chromium,** the project**! You will understand why next.

There are three main projects involved in here: Chromium, Wayland and Ozone-Wayland. In Chromium, there is a very big and geek community that mainly produces Chrome browser and Chrome-OS.]]></description>

            </div>The following message was sent out this morning &ndash; I&rsquo;m copying it here and attaching a cute screenshot of my desktop :)
Ozone is a set of C++ classes in Chromium for abstracting different window systems on Linux. It provides abstraction for the construction of accelerated surfaces underlying Aura UI framework, input devices assignment and event handling.

Today we are launching publicly Ozone-Wayland, which is the implementation of Chromium&rsquo;s Ozone for supporting Wayland graphics system.]]></description>
