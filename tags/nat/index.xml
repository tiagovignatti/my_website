    <description><![CDATA[<p>I was thinking how we could make remotely X clients totally connective with the server when <strong>both</strong> are behind a NAT/firewall.</p>
<p>We can imagine one big motivation to do this: a scenario where someone using his thin and poor machine wants to use the resources of some &ldquo;fat&rdquo; machines which he simply doesn&rsquo;t know where they are seated. Those fat machines could be arranged through a P2P network of &ldquo;X11 pool of resources&rdquo; and the list of machines displayed to the user select his desired one (e.g. with minor lag/load). Someone more capitalist than me could go further and imagine a provider selling X11 resources to mobile devices. Or just open your home machine&rsquo;s web browser in any place of the world. Well, the field of applications would be huge.</p>]]></description>
