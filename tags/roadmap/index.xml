    <description><![CDATA[<p>This week our laboratory at university <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2008-September/038674.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">released</a> the <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/mdm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">MDM</a> utility to ease the process of installation and configuration of a multiseat box. The idea is that the end-user should not use some boring and hard howtos anymore to deploy it. Just installing a distro package must be enough now. Try it, use it, report the bugs and send the patches! :)</p>
<p>But I would like to call attention here because we&rsquo;re still relying on the <a href="http://www.c3sl.ufpr.br/multiterminal/howtos/howto-xephyr-en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">ugly Xephyr solution</a> to build the multiseat on a simple PC machine (there are people selling this solution. Sigh). A lot of cool stuffs arriving in the linux graphics stack are lacking with this solution. So lets try trace the roadmap here that we can follow in the short/medium-term to build a good one solution:</p>]]></description>
