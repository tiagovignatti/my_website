    <description><![CDATA[<p>Input events routed through another thread/process can have bad effects on latency because we can&rsquo;t guarantee that it will get scheduled at the right moment. Although this is hard to see happening with the current X server threaded implementation, we must design something to avoid it. One way to improve the responsiveness is to give a high priority to the input thread and also adjust the CPU scheduling. (Note that this will not avoid problems related with <a href="http://vignatti.wordpress.com/2007/08/10/mlocking-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">page faults</a> which usually happen in the X input flow.)</p>]]></description>
