    <description><![CDATA[Following is the census of 1.10 window for all X infrastructure - raw numbers here. I did it in a similar way as the previous version. Worth to mention that there&rsquo;s almost no relation between the cycles of development from each of the components listed below, which can lead to some misunderstanding. Anyway, still a nice indicative to see and evaluate how the free desktop community behaved.
Numbers for X implementation (xserver, proto, lib and xcb repositories):]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Moikka.
If you follow here [0] you will see a set of Debian packages that Graphics team at Nokia are continuously working to deploy a X11 implementation for MeeGo-Harmattan, where we target embedded systems only. Feel free to use it!
 At this point, we are very proud of ourselves because 99% of the content on these repositories are based on the ones at X main-stream of development. IWO we are directly fetching the X code-base from freedesktop.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Topic&rsquo;s name is a funny (and friendly) devotion to GNOME Census. So let&rsquo;s take a look at some numbers from the time Xorg 1.9 was in development - raw data is here.
Would be unfair to measure only the work that happened e.g. in X server or in the drivers being developed and come up with the statistics about &ldquo;who developed X&rdquo;. X and X development community are quite extensive and don&rsquo;t concern only &ldquo;graphics&rdquo; related, i.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[For the first time in life, Xorg is being used in a single platform and for a given device only (other devices have used an X11 implementation but using other non-canonical servers, such kdrive&rsquo;s based - Tiny-X).
Previously Xorg was being packed to run in a huge amount of OSes - mostly Linux and Unix-like distributions - with the characteristic of be architecture portable and able to run on a huge set of video and input devices.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Portland, OR
I was so proud for the forth time be part of the X crew, this time in Portland. Really amazing the city. I had the opportunity to play tourist and visit some nice places.
My X conferences
BTW, I just collect the photos of all four X conferences that I&rsquo;ve attended. It&rsquo;s not much photos but there&rsquo;s some funny things :)
X on embedded
The cool thing of the work that I&rsquo;m doing at Nokia is that I can publish and discuss mostly all X fun with the open source communities.]]></description>
