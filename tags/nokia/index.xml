    <description><![CDATA[<p>Following is the census of 1.10 window for all X infrastructure - raw numbers <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~vignatti/xdevelopment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>. I did it in a similar way as the <a href="http://vignatti.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/x-census-for-1-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">previous version</a>. Worth to mention that there&rsquo;s almost no relation between the cycles of development from each of the components listed below, which can lead to some misunderstanding. Anyway, still a nice indicative to see and evaluate how the free desktop community behaved.</p>
<p>Numbers for <strong>X implementation</strong> (xserver, proto, lib and xcb repositories):</p>]]></description>

<p>If you follow <a href="http://gitorious.org/meego-w40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a> [0] you will see a set of Debian packages that Graphics team at Nokia are continuously working to deploy a X11 implementation for <a href="http://wiki.meego.com/Glossary#M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">MeeGo-Harmattan</a>, where we target embedded systems only. Feel free to use it!</p>
<hr>
<p>At this point, we are very proud of ourselves because 99% of the content on these repositories are based on the ones at X main-stream of development. IWO we are directly fetching the X code-base from freedesktop.org. More important, we are shaping freedesktop implementation for embedded devices. So at this moment, we are pretty much aligned with X version 1.9.2, plus a few of other commits from master branch; the rest of components, like client side libraries, are mostly what we have on freedesktop master also.</p>]]></description>

    <title>X Census (for 1.9)</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Topic&rsquo;s name is a funny (and friendly) devotion to <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2010/07/28/gnome-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">GNOME Census</a>. So let&rsquo;s take a look at some numbers from the time <a href="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Server19Branch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Xorg 1.9 was in development</a> - raw data is <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~vignatti/xdevelopment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Would be unfair to measure only the work that happened e.g. in X server or in the drivers being developed and come up with the statistics about &ldquo;who developed X&rdquo;. X and X development community are quite extensive and don&rsquo;t concern only &ldquo;graphics&rdquo; related, i.e., pixel information that appears on your display screen. This is a very common mistake.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Customization and true modularization of Xorg</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in life, Xorg is being used in <a href="http://maemo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">a single platform</a> and for <a href="http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">a given device</a> only (other devices have used an X11 implementation but using other non-canonical servers, such kdrive&rsquo;s based - Tiny-X).</p>
<p>Previously Xorg was being packed to run in a huge amount of OSes - mostly Linux and Unix-like distributions - with the characteristic of be architecture portable and able to run on a huge set of video and input devices. In terms of software, this means an extensive amount of code able to cover all of this mentioned. But this is far from the needs of a small and single platform device.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Portland, OR</em></strong></p>
<p>I was so proud for the forth time be part of the X crew, this time in Portland. Really amazing the city. I had the opportunity to play tourist and visit <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tiagovignatti/sets/72157622611218823/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">some nice places</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>My X conferences</strong></em></p>
<p>BTW, I just collect the photos of all four <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tiagovignatti/collections/72157622382815859/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">X conferences that I&rsquo;ve attended</a>. It&rsquo;s not much photos but there&rsquo;s some funny things :)</p>
<p><strong><em>X on embedded</em></strong></p>
<p>The cool thing of the work that I&rsquo;m doing at Nokia is that I can publish and discuss mostly all X fun with the open source communities. &ldquo;Mostly&rdquo; because, for the last device - the N-shiny-and-awesome-900 - for instance, the video driver is closed (provided by Imagination), so we cannot comment much regarding such driver stack :( C&rsquo;est la vie.</p>]]></description>
