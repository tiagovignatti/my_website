    <description><![CDATA[<p>Usually faster the number of commits, faster the development process. But development without strict reviewing doesn&rsquo;t  guarantee quality on the code. Unfortunately, rarely you will see people willing or even just being able to review the changes you are proposing. Attract reviewers is hard!</p>

<h2 id="proof-is-omitted-due-to-lack-of-space-sorry-">Proof is omitted due to lack of space. Sorry ;)</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d start to write a post about how to write a nice commit message and patch series, so I could use as a future reference <em>for you</em>.</p>]]></description>
