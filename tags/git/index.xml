    <description><![CDATA[Usually faster the number of commits, faster the development process. But development without strict reviewing doesn&rsquo;t guarantee quality on the code. Unfortunately, rarely you will see people willing or even just being able to review the changes you are proposing. Attract reviewers is hard!
Lemma: The art of writing a good patch series is all about to attract reviewers.
Proof is omitted due to lack of space. Sorry ;) I&rsquo;d start to write a post about how to write a nice commit message and patch series, so I could use as a future reference for you.]]></description>
