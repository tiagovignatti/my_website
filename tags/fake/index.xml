    <description><![CDATA[<p>For my SoC <a href="http://vignatti.wordpress.com/2008/04/29/google-summer-of-code-2008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">project</a> I need some mechanism to evaluate the improvement of the input thread inside X. So I wrote a simple kernel driver that emulates the mouse device moving and emitting bits of a simple pattern. I don&rsquo;t know if something like this already exists or if there are other ways to do it, but the fact is that the solution I thought took me only few hours between the moment that I imagined, collected some ideas on the Web and implemented it.</p>]]></description>
