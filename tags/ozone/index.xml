    <description><![CDATA[<div id="id-1"><p>About a year ago <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/&#43;/HEAD/docs/ozone_overview.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Ozone platform abstraction layer</a> started to take its shape in Chromium and we were excited how easily we could s<a href="https://vignatti.com/posts/welcome-to-chromiums-ozone-wayland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">upport Wayland platform</a> using it. Everything went great and we helped a few Chromium targets like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosswalk_Project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Crosswalk</a> to debut in the Tizen ecosystem for example. More recently, different Ozone platforms have been implemented and only now it&rsquo;s becoming evident the significance of Ozone for Chromium Linux, generally speaking.</p>]]></description>

            </div><p>A <a href="http://vignatti.com/2013/09/18/welcome-to-chromiums-ozone-wayland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">few weeks ago</a> we released Ozone-Wayland and now we&rsquo;d like to detail for you the development process and strategy behind it&hellip; ah, and the title is not developing Chromium, the browser; it&rsquo;s developing Chromium,** the project**! You will understand why next.</p>
<p><strong>communities</strong></p>
<p>There are three main projects involved in here: <em>Chromium</em>, <em>Wayland</em> and <em>Ozone-Wayland</em>. In Chromium, there is a very big and geek community that mainly produces Chrome browser and Chrome-OS. Very near to that one there&rsquo;s Blink engine&rsquo;s community, which interacts (and overlaps) a lot with the Chromium&rsquo;s; I can&rsquo;t tell exactly in numbers but there&rsquo;s huge number of people, vendors and commercial involved in Chromium and, more important to us, there&rsquo;s a lot of quality code being cooked in there for leveraging Web technologies in general.</p>]]></description>
