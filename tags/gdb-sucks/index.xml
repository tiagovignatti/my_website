    <description><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately that model which I <a href="http://vignatti.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/keep-it-going/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">described some weeks ago</a> to put the input event delivery of the X server in a separate thread wouldn&rsquo;t be an advantage. I precipitated myself thinking that it could be feasible. Sorry :(</p>
<p>I started to implement all this but it showed a very boring task to grab all the globals variables which both threads touch and to lock it. So I decided to stop going in this way. It&rsquo;s hard to program thinking in parallel. It&rsquo;s even harder to debug a program with severals flows. More, the tools don&rsquo;t help you (if you have lucky, gdb will work).</p>]]></description>
