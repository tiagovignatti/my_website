    <description><![CDATA[A rather cool feature on Weston compositor is xwayland, to support X11 native applications on Wayland. It&rsquo;s a quite important feature because gives the compatibility with the &ldquo;old&rdquo; windowing system, so say you have an application written on Motif/Xt or even something more &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; like a Web browser all tied with GTK2 and whatever dependency, then you better not bother yourself re-writing it to native Wayland or porting to a modern toolkit &ndash; it should just work seamlessly on it.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Actually this is not a big news but it&rsquo;s nice to see on practice X being used on the advanced age :) Here I&rsquo;ve played with some UI configuration settings, browsed for while, toyed with facebook, opened some photos in the viewer and etc, all for about 5 minutes:
 x-meego-Apr2011
and zooming in the X11 core slice we have:
 x-meego-x11only-Apr2011
Moral of the story: as showed on the last figure, most of the traffic from the core protocol is related with window management, window state changes and notifications of positioning for clients.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Following is the census of 1.10 window for all X infrastructure - raw numbers here. I did it in a similar way as the previous version. Worth to mention that there&rsquo;s almost no relation between the cycles of development from each of the components listed below, which can lead to some misunderstanding. Anyway, still a nice indicative to see and evaluate how the free desktop community behaved.
Numbers for X implementation (xserver, proto, lib and xcb repositories):]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Moikka.
If you follow here [0] you will see a set of Debian packages that Graphics team at Nokia are continuously working to deploy a X11 implementation for MeeGo-Harmattan, where we target embedded systems only. Feel free to use it!
 At this point, we are very proud of ourselves because 99% of the content on these repositories are based on the ones at X main-stream of development. IWO we are directly fetching the X code-base from freedesktop.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Topic&rsquo;s name is a funny (and friendly) devotion to GNOME Census. So let&rsquo;s take a look at some numbers from the time Xorg 1.9 was in development - raw data is here.
Would be unfair to measure only the work that happened e.g. in X server or in the drivers being developed and come up with the statistics about &ldquo;who developed X&rdquo;. X and X development community are quite extensive and don&rsquo;t concern only &ldquo;graphics&rdquo; related, i.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Last week I&rsquo;ve been in Brazil at 11th International Free Software Forum (FISL) talking about Linux Graphics for Small Devices*. I tried to cover a bit of everything that I learned in the world I&rsquo;ve been immersed in some near past - I guess there aren&rsquo;t many news for _freedesktopers_ though. Anyway, everyone is very welcome to give any kind of feedback and comment on it. Just follow here.

 I have started hacking on X due the laboratory at my university I was working was running an amazing project to employ computer labs in all high-schools of the state I was living, in Brazil. It was a successful and all 2.]]></description>

    <title>Toolkit, please: Xlib -&gt; XCB</title>

    <description><![CDATA[We all know since 2006 (?) that the world is turning to use XCB instead Xlib as the interface between X clients and the server. The advantages of using XCB is well know but, even so, it&rsquo;s being adopted very slowly for some reason - for instance no toolkits yet ported it. If this serves as a motivation, Alan got a really nice measurements porting a simple X app.
Translate your toolkit and application now!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So here goes some statistics of the Xorg process running. All the informations were fetch from /proc/pidof Xorg/{smaps, status}. I used also a script found on the Web to parse and organize these informations; Mikhail Gusarov has extended this script to show a very useful output.
Xorg per se Running just one standalone Xorg -retro. In my system it represents: VmRSS: 5440 kB VmSize: 13620 kB
from those 5440 kB of RSS: 3404 kB (63 %) come from code 1628 kB (30 %) come from malloc/mmap in anonymous memory (heap) 228 kB (4 %) come from other data mapped in memory 180 kB (3 %) come from rodata]]></description>
