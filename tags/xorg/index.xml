    <title>X on Wayland</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>A rather cool feature on Weston compositor is xwayland, to support X11 native applications on Wayland. It&rsquo;s a quite important feature because gives the compatibility with the &ldquo;old&rdquo; windowing system, so say you have an application written on Motif/Xt or even something more &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; like a Web browser all tied with GTK2 and whatever dependency, then you better not bother yourself re-writing it to native Wayland or porting to a modern toolkit &ndash; it should just work seamlessly on it. Hence, X on Wayland fits pretty well with our overall transition plan.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Actually this is not a big news but it&rsquo;s nice to see on practice X being used on the advanced age :) Here I&rsquo;ve played with some UI configuration settings, browsed for while, toyed with facebook, opened some photos in the viewer and etc, all for about 5 minutes:</p>

    <title>X Census (for 1.10)</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Following is the census of 1.10 window for all X infrastructure - raw numbers <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~vignatti/xdevelopment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>. I did it in a similar way as the <a href="http://vignatti.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/x-census-for-1-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">previous version</a>. Worth to mention that there&rsquo;s almost no relation between the cycles of development from each of the components listed below, which can lead to some misunderstanding. Anyway, still a nice indicative to see and evaluate how the free desktop community behaved.</p>
<p>Numbers for <strong>X implementation</strong> (xserver, proto, lib and xcb repositories):</p>]]></description>

<p>If you follow <a href="http://gitorious.org/meego-w40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a> [0] you will see a set of Debian packages that Graphics team at Nokia are continuously working to deploy a X11 implementation for <a href="http://wiki.meego.com/Glossary#M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">MeeGo-Harmattan</a>, where we target embedded systems only. Feel free to use it!</p>
<hr>
<p>At this point, we are very proud of ourselves because 99% of the content on these repositories are based on the ones at X main-stream of development. IWO we are directly fetching the X code-base from freedesktop.org. More important, we are shaping freedesktop implementation for embedded devices. So at this moment, we are pretty much aligned with X version 1.9.2, plus a few of other commits from master branch; the rest of components, like client side libraries, are mostly what we have on freedesktop master also.</p>]]></description>

    <title>X Census (for 1.9)</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Topic&rsquo;s name is a funny (and friendly) devotion to <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2010/07/28/gnome-census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">GNOME Census</a>. So let&rsquo;s take a look at some numbers from the time <a href="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Server19Branch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Xorg 1.9 was in development</a> - raw data is <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~vignatti/xdevelopment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Would be unfair to measure only the work that happened e.g. in X server or in the drivers being developed and come up with the statistics about &ldquo;who developed X&rdquo;. X and X development community are quite extensive and don&rsquo;t concern only &ldquo;graphics&rdquo; related, i.e., pixel information that appears on your display screen. This is a very common mistake.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week I&rsquo;ve been in Brazil at 11th International Free Software Forum (FISL) talking about Linux Graphics for Small Devices*. I tried to cover a bit of everything that I learned in the world I&rsquo;ve been immersed in some near past - I guess there aren&rsquo;t many news for <em>freedesktopers</em> though. Anyway, everyone is very welcome to give any kind of feedback and comment on it. Just follow <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~vignatti/talks/FISL11-LinuxGraphicsForSmallDevices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">here</a>.</p>
<p>*actually, two nights in Porto Alegre and two nights in Curitiba. Was great to see most of my friends!</p>]]></description>

<p>I have started hacking on X due the <a href="http://www.c3sl.ufpr.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">laboratory at my university</a> I was working was running an <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paran%C3%A1_Digital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">amazing project</a> to employ computer labs in all high-schools of the state I was living, in Brazil.

    <title>Toolkit, please: Xlib -&gt; XCB</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>We all know since 2006 (?) that the world is turning to use XCB instead Xlib as the interface between X clients and the server. The advantages of using XCB is <a href="http://xcb.freedesktop.org/Features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">well know</a> but, even so, it&rsquo;s being adopted very slowly for some reason - for instance no toolkits yet ported it. If this serves as a motivation, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/alanc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Alan</a> got a really <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xcb/2010-June/006111.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">nice measurements</a> porting a simple X app.</p>
<p>Translate your toolkit and application <strong>now</strong>! :)</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>So here goes some statistics of the Xorg process running. All the informations were fetch from /proc/<code>pidof Xorg</code>/{smaps, status}. I used also a <a href="http://wingolog.org/pub/mem_usage.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">script</a> found on the <a href="http://wingolog.org/archives/2007/11/27/reducing-the-footprint-of-python-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Web</a> to parse and organize these informations; Mikhail Gusarov has <a href="http://github.com/dottedmag/mem-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">extended</a> this script to show a very useful <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~vignatti/scrutinizing-x-mem/x-standalone-memory-per-libraries.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">output</a>.</p>
<h3 id="xorg-per-se">Xorg per se</h3>
<p>Running just one standalone <code>Xorg -retro</code>. In my system it represents:
VmRSS:      5440 kB
VmSize:    13620 kB</p>
<p>from those 5440 kB of RSS:
3404 kB (63 %) come from code
1628 kB (30 %) come from malloc/mmap in anonymous memory (heap)
228 kB  (4 %) come from other data mapped in memory
180 kB  (3 %) come from rodata</p>]]></description>
